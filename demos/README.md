# Examples of tree sweeping algorithms with [ITensorNetworks.jl](https://github.com/mtfishman/ITensorNetworks.jl)

Some basic examples on the use of sweeping algorithms for tree tensor networks, all of which are adapted from the ITensorNetworks.jl examples and test folders with some added explanations.

Some of the features demonstrated here (most notably the use of custom local solvers) depend somewhat on currently undocumented internals of the package, and were written assuming ITensorNetworks.jl@0.3.9.
